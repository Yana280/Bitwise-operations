## Bitwise XOR operator of 2 numbers
This C program computes the bitwise XOR of two integer variables x and y, and stores the result in a new variable a. 
The program then prints the value of a to the console. 
The bitwise XOR operator (^) compares the binary representation of each integer bit-by-bit, and returns an integer with a 1 in each position where the bits of x and y are different, and a 0 where they are the same. 
The resulting output of this program is "Bitwise XOR of two numbers is x&y is 8", which indicates that the bitwise XOR of 6 and 14 is 8.

### Algorithm
Start
Declare integer variable x and assign the value 6 to it
Declare integer variable y and assign the value 14 to it
Compute the bitwise XOR of x and y using the ^ operator and store the result in a new integer variable a
Print the value of a to the console using the printf function with the format string "Bitwise XOR of two numbers is x&y is %d"
End.
